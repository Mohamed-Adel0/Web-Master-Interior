This project is a training task from Web-Master company, where I converted a Figma design into a fully functional web page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to enhance my front-end development skills and work with Tailwind CSS efficiently. 

During the process, I focused on ensuring responsiveness and maintaining a pixel-perfect design.
